# Amazon_vine_analysis
## Overview
In this challenge we were required to use our knowledge of ETL and apply that to the Amazon Vine Program. We were tasked with figuring out whether there was any bias between those members that were required to publish a review vs those who weren't. To do this we had to use multiple different programs to extract, transform, and load our findings.

## Results
After conducting our review there were many conclusions that one can draw from our data.
* The total amount of Vine reviews were =  4291|
* The total amount of non-Vine reviews were=  1781706
* The total amount of 5 star vine reviews were = 1607
* The total amount of non-vine 5 star reviews were= 1025317
* The percentage of Vine reviews that were 5 stars= .09%
* The percentage of non-Vine reviews that were 5 stars= 57.4%

## Summary
Based off the results we can see that there was no bias in the vine program. The reason why is because the after concluding our results we can see that a total of .09% of 5 star reviews were from vine users vs the 57.4% from the non-vine users. Based off those results we had a higher percentage of non-vine users give a 5-star review than vine users. Another analysis that we can perform is linear regression test to check if there's any correlation between the variables given.
